# Joshua's Martin Jerry ESPHome Configurations

I recently bought several Martin Jerry dimmers and wall switches, after reading that they were easily switchable (or factory available) with ESPHome. Alas, they were not, so I ended up just creating valid modern, distributable, and extensible ESPHome configurations for them. You can find the following devices in this repo; please visit the subdirectories for individual READMEs.

* [Martin Jerry MJ-S01 In-wall Switch](/mj-s01)
* [Martin Jerry MJ-ST01 In-wall 3-Way Switch](/mj-st01)
* [Martin Jerry MJ-SD01 In-wall Dimmer](/mj-sd01)
